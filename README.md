This program will take the user's input into the console and print it back to them. The program will also check to see if the user is typing a number or not, and will ask the user to try again if it finds that the user's input is a whole number rather than a regular string

Peer Review: Isaiah Ferguson - Amazing well detailed code with comments it's the first time today seeing comments in code! the code is well thought out and i really like how he used the name variable at the end to say good by when you terminate the program. great use of the Data Validation aswell.
